# BITWISE OPERATIONS
* Computers operate with 1s and 0s, and there are several operations we can perform on numbers that are similar to the boolean operations

* The __boolean operations you already know from using if and while__ can be applied to __individual bits at a low level using what are called bitwise operations__
* This is useful for __masking out portions of a number, or for sometimes doing math in a faster way than you might be able to with other non-bitwise operators.__

* __Truth-tables__ : 


When you are performing a boolean operation on a multi-bit number, each pair of bits is considered in isolation. 
We perform a bitwise-AND on two bytes. 
We consider the top bit and bottom bit of each position to determine the result:



# Bitwise Ops

- Means we’ll operate on individual bits (binary digit) in a binary number
- You’ll be treating True/False as numbers

# AND
__Both must be true to return true__
        - similar to && , and 
    -If one or both is false, returns false
    - Represented with  '&'
    EX
    
AND

A B  → A AND B
1  0			0
0  0			0
0  1			0
1  1			1

Now if you have binary numbers that you use the AND operator on, then you are just comparing each place
EX with binary numbers:
A: 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
B: 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
   0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0  (A AND B)



# OR
-__Only one has to be true for it to return true. Just like when you use ‘or’ or || in your condition statements.__
-Otherwise, __if both are false, then it will return false__
-Represented with ‘|’

EX:
A B  → A OR B
1  0	  1
0  0	  0
0  1	  1
1  1      1

Now if you have binary numbers that you use the OR operator on, then you are just comparing each place
EX with binary numbers:
A: 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
B: 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
   1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 (A OR B)

# NOT
__Inverts the value (complementary value)__
Represented with ‘~’

EX:
A → NOT A
1          0
0          1

EX:
A:   1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1
~A: 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0

# NAND
This is NOT AND
__It’s an inverted AND__

A B  → A AND B → A NAND B
1  0	  0			   1
0  0	  0			   1
0  1	  0			   1
1  1      1			   0

# NOR
This is NOT OR
__Inverted of OR__

EX:
A B  → A OR B → A NOR B
1  0	1			0
0  0	0			1
0  1	1			0
1  1    1			0

Now if you have binary numbers that you use the AND operator on, then you are just comparing each place
EX with binary numbers:
A: 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
B: 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
   1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1   ->A OR B 
   0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0   ->A NOR B  

# XOR 

This is Exclusive OR
__Only returns true when one or the other is true__
Represented by '^'
EX:
A B  → A XOR B
1  0	  1
0  0	  0
0  1	  1
1  1	  0

Now if you have binary numbers that you use the AND operator on, then you are just comparing each place
EX with binary numbers:
A: 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
B: 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
   1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1   A XOR B:

This is Exclusive OR
__Only returns true when one or the other is true__

How would you perform an XOR operation between two numbers x and y if you didn’t have an XOR operator? How could you use the other bitwise operators to the same effect?
-if AND __Both must be true to return true__ NOT AND? 
-OR __Only one must be true to return true__
 // If both are 1 then 0 else xor is same as OR 
        bool xoredBit = (b1 & b2) ? 0 : (b1 | b2);
