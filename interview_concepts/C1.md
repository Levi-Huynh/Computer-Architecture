# Functional Components of CPU
what a CPU word is
    * CPU word: the natural size of a piece of data with which the CPU can interact. Usually written down in the bit “size” of the CPU, i.e. “This is a 64-bit CPU.”
    * The CPU can quickly perform math and other operations on data of its __word__ size. (It can also work with other size data, as well, though it might not be as speedy).
    * RAM(Random Access Memory): Big array of bytes that can be retrieved by index, just like a regular array.
        * The index into memory is referred to as an address or a pointer.
        * Similiar to regular indexed array: when you have the address of a value (AKA a pointer to that value), you can retrieve that value stored at that address.
    * __CPU instruction__ :  A byte or sequence of bytes in RAM that the computer knows how to interpret and perform actions based on.
        *There are instructions to do math, like ADD and SUB, instructions for comparing values like CMP, instructions for jumping to other parts of memory like JMP, and many more.
        *The exact instruction names and values vary depending on architecture.
    * __CPU register__ : The CPU has a fixed, small number of special storage locations built-in. Usually there are 16 or 32 of these, and they have fixed names, such as R0, R1, R2, and so on. (Details vary by architecture.)
        *Think of them like variables you have at your disposal to use with the various instructions.
    * __CPU clock__ : When they say your CPU is 3.2 GHz, this is what they are referring to. It’s the number of times per second the CPU does some processing
        * Each time the clock cycles, the CPU does a bit more work.
        * Some instructions take one clock cycle to complete, but others might take several.
    * __System bus__ :  A collection of wires on the motherboard between the CPU, memory, and peripherals.
        * The memory bus connects the CPU to RAM.
        * The I/O bus connects the CPU to peripherals.
        * The control bus allows the CPU to say exactly what it wants to do on the bus, e.g. read or write a word or byte.
    *__Concurrency and Parallelism__: The CPU can do multiple things once through a variety of mechanisms, including haveing multiple cores, or other features
    such as pipelining, or hyperthreading 


# How number bases work, how to count in them, and how to convert between bases.
    * The count of the number of items doesn’t change just because we refer to it in a numbering system of a different base.
    * (the only place the numbering system matters is when we write down the number someplace ) And remember that when you do write it down, the count of what the number refers to remains the same regardless of the base you choose to write it down in.
    * _Bases_ : 
        * The base of a numbering system refers to how many digits the numbering system has. 
        * Decimal numbers like we’re used to have 10 digits: 0 through 9. Decimal numbers are base-10.
            * In decimal, we have 10 digits, 0-9. Multi-digit numbers have the 1’s place, the 10’s place, and the 100’s place, etc
        * Binary numbers have two digits: 0 and 1. Binary is base-2.
            * binary, we only have two digits, 0-1. Multi-digit numbers have the 1’s place, the 2’s place, the 4’s place, the 8’s place, the 16’s place, etc.
            * 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024
            2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536
            * These are all powers of 2. 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, etc.
            * Computers find it convenient to represent numbers in base 2 for a variety of reasons. One is that it’s easy to represent as a voltage on a wire: 0 volts is a 0 and 5 volts (or whatever) is a 1. Another is that you can do boolean logic with 0 being FALSE and 1 being TRUE.
        * Hexadecimal had 16 digits: 0-9 then A-F. It’s base-16.
        * Octal; it’s base-8. (In Unix when you issue a command like chmod 755 or chmod 644, those numbers are octal.


# Convert Binary to Decimal 

```javascript
// Binary constants:

let myBinary = 0b101; // 101 binary is 5 decimal

// Converting a binary string to a Number

let myValue1 = Number('0b101');

// or

let myValue2 = parseInt('101', 2); // base 2

// All these print 5:
console.log(myBinary); // 5
console.log(myValue1); // 5
console.log(myValue2); // 5

```

Convert Binary to Decimal by Hand

+------ 8's place
|+----- 4's place
||+---- 2's place
|||+--- 1's place
||||
1010
The above example has one 8, zero 4s, one 2, and zero 1s. That is, it has one 8 and one 2. One 8 and one 2 is 10, 8+2=10, so: 
1010 binary == 10 decimal.

# Convert Decimal to Binary

```javascript
// Decimal constants (just like normal)

const val = 123;

// Converting a decimal to a binary string

const binVal = val.toString(2); // convert to base 2 number string

console.log(`${val} decimal is ${binVal} in binary`);
//Note that the result is a string. This makes sense because you already had the number in val as a Number type; the only other way to represent it is as a string.
```

# Convert Decimal to Binary by hand
Example: convert 123 decimal into binary. You have to come up with sum of the powers of two that add up to it.
So let’s put a 1 in the 64s place:
59 has a 32 in it, so that must be a 1 in the 32’s place, as well:
Then we compute 59-32=27 and go down to the next power of two: 16. There’s one 16 in 27, so that’s a 1 in the 16s place:
Then we compute 27-16=11 and do the next power of two: 8. There’s 1 8 in 11, so that’s 1, too:
Then we compute 11-8=3 and do the next power of two: 4. There are zero 4s in
We’re still at 3 decimal, but we drop to the next power of two: 2. There is one 2 in 3, so that’s a 1:

# Hexadecimal 
Counting to decimal 16 in hexadecimal goes like this:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F 10

# Convert Binary to Hex:
Fortunately, since 16 and 2 are powers of two, there are an even number of binary bits per hex digit: 4 bits per hex digit.

So if we have a 1-byte number, like 01101100, we split it in segments of 4 bits and convert each of those to a hex digit. It might be more convenient to convert do decimal first for numbers over 9 decimal.
00111100

split into sequences of 4 bits.
0011 1100

convert to hex (or decimal then hex, if more convenient):
0011 1100
 3    C      (C hex == 12 decimal == 1100 binary)

So 0b00111100 is equivalent to 0x3c. (Hex constants are written with a leading 0x in JS, C, and many other languages.)

# Converting hex to binary is the same in reverse. 4 bits per hex digit.
